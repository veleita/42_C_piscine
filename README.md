‚ö†Ô∏è[ongoing]‚ö†Ô∏è

I passed this piscine in October 2019 before I started the 42 cursus as a student in the Madrid campus.

I thought it would be interesting to review my exercises and complete those I didn't finish back in the day.
All of the original code is still there, but I have also made some additions for those exercises I would do differently now.
My idea is for this repository to be some kind of time machine for my domain on C.

This huge readme will be later written into a wiki.
